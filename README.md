# Business Intelligence + ML

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Recently I did an assessment for a company in which, in the 1st file, I had to do an **EDA** based on a given dataset of one of their apps' recent performance.

On the basis of the analysis made, I provide insight and suggestions regarding _what's_ happening in the app and _how_ to improve its performance; with the purpose of delivering it to the decision-makers. Histograms, regular expressions and a Pareto curve are just some of the examples I thought to be relevant to the analysis.

## Machine Learning Modeling
In the 2nd file I had to build a **classification Machine Learning model** in order to predict whether a user will make a purchase within the app.

In effect, this was a predictive problem taken with a ML approach. For the sake of simplicity, I used a Logistic Regression model as well as a Random Forest.
